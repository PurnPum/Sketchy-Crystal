# Pokémon Sketchy Crystal [![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci]

This is a ROM Hack based off of the disassembly of Pokémon Crystal.

It will eventually build the following ROM:

- Pokemon - Sketchy Crystal.gbc `sha1: TBD`

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Changes so far:

- All Mons are now compatible with ALL TMs/HMs

- Mons only learn Struggle at Level 1, egg moves still exist.

- Odd Eggs no longer had a set moveset, its just Struggle.

- HM Moves no longer do anything in-battle (This includes the TM for Rock Smash)

- HMs are all worth 1250 and all have Sketch. (TODO: Make cost increase with badges)

- All Shops sell TMs for Sketch. In GoldenRod and Cerulean you have to go to the actual TM floor. Rock Smash is still avaliable.
